I expect that this course would be really fun, considering the gamification part of it. Although, I also expect this to be really challenging. 

I expect the instructor to be helpful when predicaments happen, as well as be available for consultation if needed. 

I expect myself, especially with the gamification part in place, to study well and work hard in order to achieve the rewards shown on the white paper.
